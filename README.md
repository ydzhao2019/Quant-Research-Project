Firstly estimate Garch model parameters using Maximum Likelihood Estimation and add S&P500 trading volume as a macroeconomic factor into Garch Variance model;
Then Generate Empirical Martingale Simulation with three types of variance model: constant variance, Garch variance, Garch+macroeconomic factors variance;
Lastly use the Empirical Martingale Simulations to calculate option prices and implied vol, then compare them with market option prices and implied vol to see which variance model can fit the market implied vol better.
