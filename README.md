Part 1: Implemented long-short alpha strategy based on CAPM and Fama-French three factor model to justify Jensenâ€™s alpha

Part 2: Combined Garch model with Empirical Martingale Simulation to value options and to explain market implied vol smile

Firstly estimate Garch model parameters using Maximum Likelihood Estimation and add S&P500 trading volume as a macroeconomic factor into Garch Variance model;

Then Generate Empirical Martingale Simulation with three types of variance model: constant variance, Garch variance, Garch+macroeconomic factors variance;

Lastly use the three types of Empirical Martingale Simulations to calculate option prices and implied vol, then compare them with market option prices and implied vol to see which variance model can fit the market implied vol better.
